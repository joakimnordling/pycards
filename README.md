# Card game design iteration with Python

This repo has an example how to create a printable card game with Python.
The goal is to support game design iteration, so enable a fast loop of:

  1. Change game rules.
  2. Generate card images.
  3. Print & play, play online in Tabletop Simulator, or use a service like The Gamecrafter to print the cards.
  4. Playtest & receive feedback & go back to 1.

[Battles in Antiquity](src/battles_in_antiquity)
is a complete example of a prototype card game.

[pycards](src/pycards)
is a Python package with support functions to e.g. render images.
